# Axol Bot for Revolt.chat

Here is the changelog for all of the changes made to the Axol bot.

### Version 1.0.0 - May 17th, 2025

The first release for the Axol Bot from Axol's Software. Here is the features of the initial release.

- The bot is using revolt.js v6.0.20
- Added the following commands: help, ping, botinfo, say, esay, dice, serverinfo, addcmd, deletecmd, listcmds, resetccmds, nick, purge, kick, ban, unban
- The custom commands and say commands have a filter so bad stuff can not be said through the bot.
- You can not create custom commands with a command name of an already built-in command and you need the Kick Members permission to create and remove custom commands.
- Custom commands supports embed and standard response messages
- Code includes a webserver with the index page with documentation and privacy policy.
- The project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0

Note: This was going to have a timeout command but I gave up on this because it is somehow impossible to do and I am still getting little to no help.
